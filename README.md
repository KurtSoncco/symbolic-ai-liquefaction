## 🎯 Research Questions / Hypothesis

> - _Question 1: How much improvement can the AI have in energy-based relationships in geotechnical parameters such as Shear Wave Velocity (Vs) and Liquefaction triggering?
> - _Question 2: How muxh explainability can we get based on symbolic AI results compared to human-based relationships?

## 🛠️ Methodology

> _Describe the methodology used. What models, algorithms, or statistical techniques were employed? What was the experimental setup?_

---

## 💾 Data

> _Describe the dataset(s) used in this analysis. Provide a link to the original source if possible and explain any key preprocessing steps. Note: Do not commit large data files to Git._
> 
> The final dataset for this project can be found at: `[Link to cloud storage, university server, etc.]`

## 🚀 How to Reproduce

> _Provide step-by-step instructions to set up the environment and run the analysis._

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KurtSoncco/symbolic-ai-liquefaction.git
    cd symbolic-ai-liquefaction
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    pyenv local 3.12
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Sync dependencies using uv:**
    This command installs the exact dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`.
    ```bash
    uv sync --extra dev
    ```
4.  **Run the analysis:**
    > _Explain the final step. Is it running a notebook or a script?_
    > e.g., "Open and run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory in sequential order."
