## 🚀 How to Reproduce

> _Provide step-by-step instructions to set up the environment and run the analysis._

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [URL_OF_THIS_REPO]
    cd [NAME_OF_THIS_REPO]
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Sync dependencies using uv:**
    This command installs the exact dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`.
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```
4.  **Run the analysis:**
    > _Explain the final step. Is it running a notebook or a script?_
    > e.g., "Open and run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory in sequential order."
